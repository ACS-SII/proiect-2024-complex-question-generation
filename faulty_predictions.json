The menopausal decrease in inhibin leads to an increase in FSH . The presence of FSH stimulates more follicles to grow and secrete estrogen . Because small , secondary follicles also respond to increases in FSH levels , larger numbers of follicles are stimulated to grow ; however , most undergo atresia and die .

        "question": "Axons from which neuron in the retina make up the optic nerve?",
        "context": "The retina is composed of several layers and contains specialized cells for the initial processing of visual stimuli . The photoreceptors ( rods and cones ) change their membrane potential when stimulated by light energy . The change in membrane potential alters the amount of neurotransmitter that the photoreceptor cells release onto bipolar cells in the outer synaptic layer .  It is the bipolar cell in the retina that connects a photoreceptor to a retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) in the inner synaptic layer .  There , amacrine cells additionally contribute to retinal processing before an action potential is produced by the RGC .  The axons of RGCs , which lie at the innermost layer of the retina , collect at the optic disc and leave the eye as the optic nerve ( see Figure 14.15 ) .  Because these axons pass through the retina , there are no photoreceptors at the very back of the eye , where the optic nerve begins . This creates a \" blind spot \" in the retina , and a corresponding blind spot in our visual field . Note that the photoreceptors in the retina ( rods and cones ) are located behind the axons , RGCs , bipolar cells , and retinal blood vessels . A significant amount of light is absorbed by these structures before the light reaches the photoreceptor cells . However , at the exact center of the retina is a small area known as the fovea . At the fovea , the retina lacks the supporting cells and blood vessels , and only contains photoreceptors . Therefore , visual acuity , or the sharpness of vision , is greatest at the fovea . This is because the fovea is where the least amount of incoming light is absorbed by other retinal structures ( see Figure 14.15 ) . As one moves in either direction from this central point of the retina , visual acuity drops significantly . In addition , each photoreceptor cell of the fovea is connected to a single RGC . Therefore , this RGC does not have to integrate inputs from multiple photoreceptors , which reduces the accuracy of visual transduction . Toward the edges of the retina , several photoreceptors converge on RGCs ( through the bipolar cells ) up to a ratio of 50 to 1 . The difference in visual acuity between the fovea and peripheral retina is easily evidenced by looking directly at a word in the middle of this paragraph . The visual stimulus in the middle of the field of view falls on the fovea and is in the sharpest focus . Without moving your eyes off that word , notice that words at the beginning or end of the paragraph are not in focus . The images in your peripheral vision are focused by the peripheral retina , and have vague , blurry edges and words that are not as clearly identified . As a result , a large part of the neural function of the eyes is concerned with moving the eyes and head so that important visual stimuli are centered on the fovea . Light falling on the retina causes chemical changes to pigment molecules in the photoreceptors , ultimately leading to a change in the activity of the RGCs . Photoreceptor cells have two parts , the inner segment and the outer segment ( Figure 14.16 ) . The inner segment contains the nucleus and other common organelles of a cell , whereas the outer segment is a specialized region in which photoreception takes place . There are two types of photoreceptors -- rods and cones -- which differ in the shape of their outer segment . The rod-shaped outer segments of the rod photoreceptor contain a stack of membrane-bound discs that contain the photosensitive pigment rhodopsin . The cone-shaped outer segments of the cone photoreceptor contain their photosensitive pigments in infoldings of the cell membrane . There are three cone photopigments , called opsins , which are each sensitive to a particular wavelength of light . The wavelength of visible light determines its color . The pigments in human eyes are specialized in perceiving three different primary colors : red , green , and blue . At the molecular level , visual stimuli cause changes in the photopigment molecule that lead to changes in membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell . A single unit of light is called a photon , which is described in physics as a packet of energy with properties of both a particle and a wave . The energy of a photon is represented by its wavelength , with each wavelength of visible light corresponding to a particular color . Visible light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 and 720 nm . Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation longer than 720 nm fall into the infrared range , whereas wavelengths shorter than 380 nm fall into the ultraviolet range . Light with a wavelength of 380 nm is blue whereas light with a wavelength of 720 nm is dark red . All other colors fall between red and blue at various points along the wavelength scale . Opsin pigments are actually transmembrane proteins that contain a cofactor known as retinal . Retinal is a hydrocarbon molecule related to vitamin A . When a photon hits retinal , the long hydrocarbon chain of the molecule is biochemically altered . Specifically , photons cause some of the double-bonded carbons within the chain to switch from a cis to a trans conformation . This process is called photoisomerization . Before interacting with a photon , retinal ' s flexible double-bonded carbons are in the cis conformation . This molecule is referred to as 11 - cis - retinal . A photon interacting with the molecule causes the flexible double-bonded carbons to change to the trans - conformation , forming all - trans - retinal , which has a straight hydrocarbon chain ( Figure 14.17 ) . The shape change of retinal in the photoreceptors initiates visual transduction in the retina . Activation of retinal and the opsin proteins result in activation of a G protein . The G protein changes the membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell , which then releases less neurotransmitter into the outer synaptic layer of the retina . Until the retinal molecule is changed back to the 11 - cis - retinal shape , the opsin cannot respond to light energy , which is called bleaching . When a large group of photopigments is bleached , the retina will send information as if opposing visual information is being perceived . After a bright flash of light , afterimages are usually seen in negative . The photoisomerization is reversed by a series of enzymatic changes so that the retinal responds to more light energy .",

Most predictions in fact suggest that , due to continuing demographic changes including slower population growth and an aging population , by 2033 , the amount of revenue generated from payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover costs .  The Bush administration proposed avoiding this by privatizing the program , in effect , taking it out of the government ' s hands and making individuals ' benefits variable instead of defined .  The effort ultimately failed , and Social Security ' s long-term viability continues to remain uncertain . Numerous other plans for saving the program have been proposed , including raising the retirement age , increasing payroll taxes ( especially on the wealthy ) by removing the $ 118,500 income cap , and reducing payouts for wealthier retirees . None of these proposals have been able to gain traction , however . On March 25 , 2010 , both chambers of Congress passed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ( HCERA ) .  1 The story of the HCERA , which expanded and improved some provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) , also known as Obamacare , is a complicated tale of insider politics in which the Democratic Party was able to enact sweeping health care and higher education reforms over fierce Republican opposition ( Figure 16.1 ) .

For this protein synthesis , many ribosomes attach to the ER ( giving it the studded appearance of rough ER ) .  Typically , a protein is synthesized within the ribosome and released inside the channel of the rough ER , where sugars can be added to it ( by a process called glycosylation ) before it is transported within a vesicle to the next stage in the packaging and shipping process : the Golgi apparatus . The endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is a system of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane ( or \" envelope \" ) covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material . The ER can be thought of as a series of winding thoroughfares similar to the waterway canals in Venice . The ER provides passages throughout much of the cell that function in transporting , synthesizing , and storing materials . The winding structure of the ER results in a large membranous surface area that supports its many functions ( Figure 3.14 ) . Endoplasmic reticulum can exist in two forms : rough ER and smooth ER . These two types of ER perform some very different functions and can be found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell .  Rough ER ( RER ) is so-called because its membrane is dotted with embedded granules -- organelles called ribosomes , giving the RER a bumpy appearance .

        "context": "A DNA molecule is made of two strands that \" complement \" each other in the sense that the molecules that compose the strands fit together and bind to each other , creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a long , twisted ladder . This double helix can be constructed easily because the two strands are antiparallel , meaning the two strands run in opposite directions . Each side rail of the DNA ladder is composed of alternating sugar and phosphate groups ( Figure 3.23 ) . The two sides of the ladder are not identical , but are complementary . These two backbones are bonded to each other across pairs of protruding bases , each bonded pair forming one \" rung , \" or cross member . The four DNA bases are adenine ( A ) , thymine ( T ) , cytosine ( C ) , and guanine ( G ) . Because of their shape and charge , the two bases that compose a pair always bond together .  Adenine always binds with thymine , and cytosine always binds with guanine .  The particular sequence of bases along the DNA molecule determines the genetic code . Therefore , if the two complementary strands of DNA were pulled apart , you could infer the order of the bases in one strand from the bases in the other , complementary strand . For example , if one strand has a region with the sequence AGTGCCT , then the sequence of the complementary strand would be TCACGGA .

        "question": "How many \"letters\" of an RNA molecule, in sequence, does it take to provide the code for a single amino acid?",
        "context": "Remember that many of a cell ' s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER , and carry out the synthesis of proteins destined for the Golgi apparatus . Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is a type of RNA that , together with proteins , composes the structure of the ribosome . Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm as two distinct components , a small and a large subunit . When an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated , the two subunits come together and attach to the mRNA . The ribosome provides a substrate for translation , bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule with the molecular \" translators \" that must decipher its code . The other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically \" read \" the mRNA codons . Transfer RNA ( tRNA ) is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the ribosome , and attaches each new amino acid to the last , building the polypeptide chain one-by-one . Thus tRNA transfers specific amino acids from the cytoplasm to a growing polypeptide . The tRNA molecules must be able to recognize the codons on mRNA and match them with the correct amino acid . The tRNA is modified for this function . On one end of its structure is a binding site for a specific amino acid . On the other end is a base sequence that matches the codon specifying its particular amino acid .  This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called an anticodon .  For example , a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for glycine on one end . On the other end it contains an anticodon that complements the glycine codon ( GGA is a codon for glycine , and so the tRNAs anticodon would read CCU ) . Equipped with its particular cargo and matching anticodon , a tRNA molecule can read its recognized mRNA codon and bring the corresponding amino acid to the growing chain ( Figure 3.28 ) .",

        "context": " A delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately controls the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate .   Therefore , a disruption of this homeostatic balance can cause aberrant cell division and cancerous growths .  In addition to cyclins , a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important signals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward . Examples of proto-oncogene products include cell-surface receptors for growth factors , or cell-signaling molecules , two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication and cell division . In contrast , a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes sends stop signals during a cell cycle .  For example , certain protein products of tumor suppressor genes signal potential problems with the DNA and thus stop the cell from dividing , while other proteins signal the cell to die if it is damaged beyond repair .  Some tumor suppressor proteins also signal a sufficient surrounding cellular density , which indicates that the cell need not presently divide . The latter function is uniquely important in preventing tumor growth : normal cells exhibit a phenomenon called \" contact inhibition ; \" thus , extensive cellular contact with neighboring cells causes a signal that stops further cell division .",

This arrangement is referred to as multipennate . A common example is the deltoid muscle of the shoulder , which covers the shoulder but has a single tendon that inserts on the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus .  Pennate muscles ( penna = \" feathers \" ) blend into a tendon that runs through the central region of the muscle for its whole length , somewhat like the quill of a feather with the muscle arranged similar to the feathers .   Due to this design , the muscle fibers in a pennate muscle can only pull at an angle , and as a result , contracting pennate muscles do not move their tendons very far .

        "context": " The next 150 years saw the rise of American slavery , with black Africans being kidnapped from their own lands and shipped to the New World on the trans-Atlantic journey known as the Middle Passage .  Once in the Americas , the black population grew until American-born blacks outnumbered those born in Africa .  But colonial ( and later , American ) slave codes declared that the child of a slave was a slave , so the slave class was created .  By 1869 , the slave trade was internal in the United States , with slaves being bought and sold across state lines like livestock .  If Native Americans are the only minority group whose subordinate status occurred by conquest , African Americans are the exemplar minority group in the United States whose ancestors did not come here by choice .  A Dutch sea captain brought the first Africans to the Virginia colony of Jamestown in 1619 and sold them as indentured servants . This was not an uncommon practice for either blacks or whites , and indentured servants were in high demand . For the next century , black and white indentured servants worked side by side . But the growing agricultural economy demanded greater and cheaper labor , and by 1705 , Virginia passed the slave codes declaring that any foreign-born non-Christian could be a slave , and that slaves were considered property . The social construction of race is also reflected in the way that names for racial categories change with changing times . It ' s worth noting that race , in this sense , is also a system of labeling that provides a source of identity ; specific labels fall in and out of favor during different social eras .  For example , the category \" negroid , \" popular in the 19th century , evolved into the term \" negro \" by the 1960s , and then this term fell from use and was replaced with \" African American . \" This latter term was intended to celebrate the multiple identities that a black person might hold , but the word choice is a poor one : it lumps together a large variety of ethnic groups under an umbrella term while excluding others who could accurately be described by the label but who do not meet the spirit of the term .  For example , actress Charlize Theron is a blonde-haired , blue-eyed \" African American . \" She was born in South Africa and later became a U . S . citizen .

        "context": " Based on molecular analysis , vertebrates appear to be more closely related to lancelets ( cephalochordates ) than to tunicates ( urochordates ) among the invertebrate chordates .  This evidence suggests that the cephalochordates diverged from Urochordata and the vertebrates subsequently diverged from the cephalochordates . This hypothesis is further supported by the discovery of a fossil in China from the genus Haikouella . This organism seems to be an intermediate form between cephalochordates and vertebrates . The Haikouella fossils are about 530 million years old and appear similar to modern lancelets . These organisms had a brain and eyes , as do vertebrates , but lack the skull found in craniates . 1 This evidence suggests that vertebrates arose during the Cambrian explosion . Recall that the \" Cambrian explosion \" is the name given to a relatively brief span of time during the Cambrian period during which many animal groups appeared and rapidly diversified . Most modern animal phyla originated during the Cambrian explosion . 1 Chen , J . Y . , Huang , D . Y . , and Li , C .

More than one classification and naming scheme is used for these animals . Here we will consider the traditional groups Agnatha , Chondrichthyes , Osteichthyes , Amphibia , Reptilia , Aves , and Mammalia , which constitute classes in the subphylum Vertebrata . Many modern authors classify birds within Reptilia , which correctly reflects their evolutionary heritage . We consider them separately only for convenience . Further , we will consider hagfishes and lampreys together as jawless fishes , the agnathans , although emerging classification schemes separate them into chordate jawless fishes ( the hagfishes ) and vertebrate jawless fishes ( the lampreys ) .",

Regarding physical activity , for instance , the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) recommends that individuals use a standard level of exertion to assess their physical activity .   This Rating of Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) gives a more complete view of an individual ' s actual exertion level , since heart-rate or pulse measurements may be affected by medication or other issues ( Centers for Disease Control 2011a ) .  Similarly , many medical professionals use a comparable scale for perceived pain to help determine pain management strategies .  The Social Construction of the Illness Experience The idea of the social construction of the illness experience is based on the concept of reality as a social construction .   In other words , there is no objective reality ; there are only our own perceptions of it .   The social construction of the illness experience deals with such issues as the way some patients control the manner in which they reveal their disease and the lifestyle adaptations patients develop to cope with their illnesses .  The social construction of health is a major research topic within medical sociology . At first glance , the concept of a social construction of health does not seem to make sense . After all , if disease is a measurable , physiological problem , then there can be no question of socially constructing disease , right ? Well , it ' s not that simple .  The idea of the social construction of health emphasizes the socio-cultural aspects of the discipline ' s approach to physical , objectively definable phenomena .  Sociologists Conrad and Barker ( 2010 ) offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the major findings of the last 50 years of development in this concept .

For example , PETA , a social movement organization , is in competition with Greenpeace and the Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) , two other social movement organizations .  Taken together , along with all other social movement organizations working on animals rights issues , these similar organizations constitute a social movement industry . Multiple social movement industries in a society , though they may have widely different constituencies and goals , constitute a society's social movement sector . Every social movement organization ( a single social movement group ) within the social movement sector is competing for your attention , your time , and your resources . The chart below shows the relationship between these components . The conflict perspective focuses on the creation and reproduction of inequality .  Someone applying the conflict perspective would likely be interested in how social movements are generated through systematic inequality , and how social change is constant , speedy , and unavoidable .  In fact , the conflict that this perspective sees as inherent in social relations drives social change .  For example , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) was founded in 1908 .

The hormones released from the adrenal medulla -- epinephrine and norepinephrine -- will also bind to these receptors .  Those hormones travel through the bloodstream where they can easily interact with the receptors in the vessel walls . The parasympathetic system has no significant input to the systemic blood vessels , so the sympathetic system determines their tone .

Photoreceptors are activated , and the signal is transferred to the retinal ganglion cells that send an action potential along the optic nerve into the diencephalon .

Phenylephrine is known as an a 1 - adrenergic agonist , meaning that it binds to a specific adrenergic receptor , stimulating a response .  In this role , phenylephrine will bind to the adrenergic receptors in bronchioles of the lungs and cause them to dilate . By opening these structures , accumulated mucus can be cleared out of the lower respiratory tract . Phenylephrine is often paired with other pharmaceuticals , such as analgesics , as in the \" sinus \" version of many over-the-counter drugs , such as Tylenol Sinus ®️ or Excedrin Sinus ®️ , or in expectorants for chest congestion such as in Robitussin CF ®️ . A related molecule , called pseudoephedrine , was much more commonly used in these applications than was phenylephrine , until the molecule became useful in the illicit production of amphetamines . Phenylephrine is not as effective as a drug because it can be partially broken down in the digestive tract before it is ever absorbed . Like the adrenergic agents , phenylephrine is effective in dilating the pupil , known as mydriasis ( Figure 15.14 ) .

When the ventricle relaxes and blood attempts to flow back into the ventricle from the aorta , blood will fill the cusps of the valve , causing it to close and producing an audible sound .  Located at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve , also called the bicuspid valve or the left atrioventricular valve .  Structurally , this valve consists of two cusps , compared to the three cusps of the tricuspid valve . In a clinical setting , the valve is referred to as the mitral valve , rather than the bicuspid valve . The two cusps of the mitral valve are attached by chordae tendineae to two papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle .  A transverse section through the heart slightly above the level of the atrioventricular septum reveals all four heart valves along the same plane ( Figure 19.12 ) .   The valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart .   Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the right atrioventricular valve , or tricuspid valve .

The flaps are connected by chordae tendineae to the papillary muscles , which control the opening and closing of the valves .

Since the SA node is the pacemaker , it reaches threshold faster than any other component of the conduction system . It will initiate the impulses spreading to the other conducting cells . The SA node , without nervous or endocrine control , would initiate a heart impulse approximately 80 - 100 times per minute . Although each component of the conduction system is capable of generating its own impulse , the rate progressively slows as you proceed from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers .  Without the SA node , the AV node would generate a heart rate of 40 - 60 beats per minute .   If the AV node were blocked , the atrioventricular bundle would fire at a rate of approximately 30 - 40 impulses per minute .   The bundle branches would have an inherent rate of 20 - 30 impulses per minute , and the Purkinje fibers would fire at 15 - 20 impulses per minute .  While a few exceptionally trained aerobic athletes demonstrate resting heart rates in the range of 30 - 40 beats per minute ( the lowest recorded figure is 28 beats per minute for Miguel Indurain , a cyclist ) , for most individuals , rates lower than 50 beats per minute would indicate a condition called bradycardia .

        "context": "Initially , physiological conditions that cause HR to increase also trigger an increase in SV . During exercise , the rate of blood returning to the heart increases . However as the HR rises , there is less time spent in diastole and consequently less time for the ventricles to fill with blood . Even though there is less filling time , SV will initially remain high . However , as HR continues to increase , SV gradually decreases due to decreased filling time . CO will initially stabilize as the increasing HR compensates for the decreasing SV , but at very high rates , CO will eventually decrease as increasing rates are no longer able to compensate for the decreasing SV . Consider this phenomenon in a healthy young individual . Initially , as HR increases from resting to approximately 120 bpm , CO will rise . As HR increases from 120 to 160 bpm , CO remains stable , since the increase in rate is offset by decreasing ventricular filling time and , consequently , SV .  As HR continues to rise above 160 bpm , CO actually decreases as SV falls faster than HR increases .  So although aerobic exercises are critical to maintain the health of the heart , individuals are cautioned to monitor their HR to ensure they stay within the target heart rate range of between 120 and 160 bpm , so CO is maintained . The target HR is loosely defined as the range in which both the heart and lungs receive the maximum benefit from the aerobic workout and is dependent upon age .  Cardiac output ( CO ) is a measurement of the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle in one minute .   To calculate this value , multiply stroke volume ( SV ) , the amount of blood pumped by each ventricle , by heart rate ( HR ) , in contractions per minute ( or beats per minute , bpm ) .

By varying the amount of water that is recovered , the collecting ducts play a major role in maintaining the body ' s normal osmolarity .  If the blood becomes hyperosmotic , the collecting ducts recover more water to dilute the blood ; if the blood becomes hyposmotic , the collecting ducts recover less of the water , leading to concentration of the blood . Another way of saying this is : If plasma osmolarity rises , more water is recovered and urine volume decreases ; if plasma osmolarity decreases , less water is recovered and urine volume increases . This function is regulated by the posterior pituitary hormone ADH ( vasopressin ) . With mild dehydration , plasma osmolarity rises slightly . This increase is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus , which stimulates the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary . If plasma osmolarity decreases slightly , the opposite occurs . With up to 180 liters per day passing through the nephrons of the kidney , it is quite obvious that most of that fluid and its contents must be reabsorbed . That recovery occurs in the PCT , loop of Henle , DCT , and the collecting ducts ( Table 25.5 and Figure 25.17 ) . Various portions of the nephron differ in their capacity to reabsorb water and specific solutes . While much of the reabsorption and secretion occur passively based on concentration gradients , the amount of water that is reabsorbed or lost is tightly regulated . This control is exerted directly by ADH and aldosterone , and indirectly by renin . Most water is recovered in the PCT , loop of Henle , and DCT . About 10 percent ( about 18 L ) reaches the collecting ducts .

Natriuretic hormones act by inhibiting aldosterone release and therefore inhibiting Na + recovery in the collecting ducts . If Na + remains in the forming urine , its osmotic force will cause a concurrent loss of water . Natriuretic hormones also inhibit ADH release , which of course will result in less water recovery . Therefore , natriuretic peptides inhibit both Na + and water recovery .  One example from this family of hormones is atrial natriuretic hormone ( ANH ) , a 28 - amino acid peptide produced by heart atria in response to over-stretching of the atrial wall .   The over-stretching occurs in persons with elevated blood pressure or heart failure .  It increases GFR through concurrent vasodilation of the afferent arteriole and vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole . These events lead to an increased loss of water and sodium in the forming urine . It also decreases sodium reabsorption in the DCT . There is also B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) of 32 amino acids produced in the ventricles of the heart . It has a 10 - fold lower affinity for its receptor , so its effects are less than those of ANH . Its role may be to provide \" fine tuning \" for the regulation of blood pressure .

Increased blood flow results in apparent redness and heat .   In response to injury , mast cells present in tissue degranulate , releasing the potent vasodilator histamine .  Increased blood flow and inflammatory mediators recruit white blood cells to the site of inflammation . The endothelium lining the local blood vessel becomes \" leaky \" under the influence of histamine and other inflammatory mediators allowing neutrophils , macrophages , and fluid to move from the blood into the interstitial tissue spaces . The excess liquid in tissue causes swelling , more properly called edema . The swollen tissues squeezing pain receptors cause the sensation of pain . Prostaglandins released from injured cells also activate pain neurons . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) reduce pain because they inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins . High levels of NSAIDs reduce inflammation . Antihistamines decrease allergies by blocking histamine receptors and as a result the histamine response . The mast cell , found in connective tissue proper , has many cytoplasmic granules . These granules contain the chemical signals histamine and heparin .  When irritated or damaged , mast cells release histamine , an inflammatory mediator , which causes vasodilation and increased blood flow at a site of injury or infection , along with itching , swelling , and redness you recognize as an allergic response .

The root is the region of the nose located between the eyebrows . The bridge is the part of the nose that connects the root to the rest of the nose . The dorsum nasi is the length of the nose . The apex is the tip of the nose . On either side of the apex , the nostrils are formed by the alae ( singular = ala ) . An ala is a cartilaginous structure that forms the lateral side of each naris ( plural = nares ) , or nostril opening . The philtrum is the concave surface that connects the apex of the nose to the upper lip . Underneath the thin skin of the nose are its skeletal features ( see Figure 22.3 , lower illustration ) . While the root and bridge of the nose consist of bone , the protruding portion of the nose is composed of cartilage . As a result , when looking at a skull , the nose is missing . The nasal bone is one of a pair of bones that lies under the root and bridge of the nose . The nasal bone articulates superiorly with the frontal bone and laterally with the maxillary bones . Septal cartilage is flexible hyaline cartilage connected to the nasal bone , forming the dorsum nasi . The alar cartilage consists of the apex of the nose ; it surrounds the naris . The nares open into the nasal cavity , which is separated into left and right sections by the nasal septum ( Figure 22.4 ) . The nasal septum is formed anteriorly by a portion of the septal cartilage ( the flexible portion you can touch with your fingers ) and posteriorly by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone ( a cranial bone located just posterior to the nasal bones ) and the thin vomer bones ( whose name refers to its plough shape ) . Each lateral wall of the nasal cavity has three bony projections , called the superior , middle , and inferior nasal conchae . The inferior conchae are separate bones , whereas the superior and middle conchae are portions of the ethmoid bone .  Conchae serve to increase the surface area of the nasal cavity and to disrupt the flow of air as it enters the nose , causing air to bounce along the epithelium , where it is cleaned and warmed .  The conchae and meatuses also conserve water and prevent dehydration of the nasal epithelium by trapping water during exhalation . The floor of the nasal cavity is composed of the palate .

        "context": " Pulmonary ventilation is dependent on three types of pressure : atmospheric , intra-alveolar , and intrapleural .  Atmospheric pressure is the amount of force that is exerted by gases in the air surrounding any given surface , such as the body . Atmospheric pressure can be expressed in terms of the unit atmosphere , abbreviated atm , or in millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ) . One atm is equal to 760 mm Hg , which is the atmospheric pressure at sea level . Typically , for respiration , other pressure values are discussed in relation to atmospheric pressure . Therefore , negative pressure is pressure lower than the atmospheric pressure , whereas positive pressure is pressure that it is greater than the atmospheric pressure . A pressure that is equal to the atmospheric pressure is expressed as zero . Intra-alveolar pressure ( intrapulmonary pressure ) is the pressure of the air within the alveoli , which changes during the different phases of breathing ( Figure 22.16 ) . Because the alveoli are connected to the atmosphere via the tubing of the airways ( similar to the two - and one-liter containers in the example above ) , the intrapulmonary pressure of the alveoli always equalizes with the atmospheric pressure . Intrapleural pressure is the pressure of the air within the pleural cavity , between the visceral and parietal pleurae . Similar to intra-alveolar pressure , intrapleural pressure also changes during the different phases of breathing . However , due to certain characteristics of the lungs , the intrapleural pressure is always lower than , or negative to , the intra-alveolar pressure ( and therefore also to atmospheric pressure ) . Although it fluctuates during inspiration and expiration , intrapleural pressure remains approximately - 4 mm Hg throughout the breathing cycle .  Pulmonary ventilation is the act of breathing , which can be described as the movement of air into and out of the lungs .

Additional muscles can be used if a bigger breath is required . When the diaphragm contracts , it moves inferiorly toward the abdominal cavity , creating a larger thoracic cavity and more space for the lungs .  Contraction of the external intercostal muscles moves the ribs upward and outward , causing the rib cage to expand , which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity .  Due to the adhesive force of the pleural fluid , the expansion of the thoracic cavity forces the lungs to stretch and expand as well .

But as soot began spewing from factories , the trees became darkened , and the light-colored moths became easier for predatory birds to spot . Over time , the frequency of the melanic form of the moth increased because they had a higher survival rate in habitats affected by air pollution because their darker coloration blended with the sooty trees . Similarly , the hypothetical mouse population may evolve to take on a different coloration if something were to cause the forest floor where they live to change color .

There are characteristic modifications to histone proteins and DNA that are associated with silenced genes .  In cancer cells , the DNA in the promoter region of silenced genes is methylated on cytosine DNA residues in CpG islands . Histone proteins that surround that region lack the acetylation modification that is present when the genes are expressed in normal cells . This combination of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation ( epigenetic modifications that lead to gene silencing ) is commonly found in cancer . When these modifications occur , the gene present in that chromosomal region is silenced . Increasingly , scientists understand how epigenetic changes are altered in cancer . Because these changes are temporary and can be reversed -- for example , by preventing the action of the histone deacetylase protein that removes acetyl groups , or by DNA methyl transferase enzymes that add methyl groups to cytosines in DNA -- it is possible to design new drugs and new therapies to take advantage of the reversible nature of these processes . Indeed , many researchers are testing how a silenced gene can be switched back on in a cancer cell to help re-establish normal growth patterns .  This type of gene regulation is called epigenetic regulation .   Epigenetic means \" around genetics . \" The changes that occur to the histone proteins and DNA do not alter the nucleotide sequence and are not permanent .  Instead , these changes are temporary ( although they often persist through multiple rounds of cell division ) and alter the chromosomal structure ( open or closed ) as needed . A gene can be turned on or off depending upon the location and modifications to the histone proteins and DNA . If a gene is to be transcribed , the histone proteins and DNA are modified surrounding the chromosomal region encoding that gene . This opens the chromosomal region to allow access for RNA polymerase and other proteins , called transcription factors , to bind to the promoter region , located just upstream of the gene , and initiate transcription . If a gene is to remain turned off , or silenced , the histone proteins and DNA have different modifications that signal a closed chromosomal configuration . In this closed configuration , the RNA polymerase and transcription factors do not have access to the DNA and transcription cannot occur ( Figure 16.7 ) .",

Because proteins are involved in every stage of gene regulation , the phosphorylation of a protein ( depending on the protein that is modified ) can alter accessibility to the chromosome , can alter translation ( by altering transcription factor binding or function ) , can change nuclear shuttling ( by influencing modifications to the nuclear pore complex ) , can alter RNA stability ( by binding or not binding to the RNA to regulate its stability ) , can modify translation ( increase or decrease ) , or can change post-translational modifications ( add or remove phosphates or other chemical modifications ) .   Control of RNA Stability   RNA splicing , the first stage of post-transcriptional control In eukaryotic cells , the RNA transcript often contains regions , called introns , that are removed prior to translation .  The regions of RNA that code for protein are called exons ( Figure 16.10 ) .

Evolution Connection Alternative RNA Splicing RNA is transcribed , but must be processed into a mature form before translation can begin .  This processing after an RNA molecule has been transcribed , but before it is translated into a protein , is called post-transcriptional modification .

Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that , when mutated in certain ways , become oncogenes , genes that cause a cell to become cancerous . Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene . In most instances , the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a less functional ( or non-functional ) protein . The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle ; however , the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward . If a cell cannot reproduce , the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal .  Occasionally , however , a gene mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator .   For example , a mutation that allows Cdk to be activated without being partnered with cyclin could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met .  If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undergo further cell divisions , the mutation would not be propagated and no harm would come to the organism . However , if the atypical daughter cells are able to undergo further cell divisions , subsequent generations of cells will probably accumulate even more mutations , some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle .  Cyclins regulate the cell cycle only when they are tightly bound to Cdks .   To be fully active , the Cdk / cyclin complex must also be phosphorylated in specific locations .   Like all kinases , Cdks are enzymes ( kinases ) that phosphorylate other proteins .   Phosphorylation activates the protein by changing its shape .   The proteins phosphorylated by Cdks are involved in advancing the cell to the next phase .  ( Figure 10.12 ) . The levels of Cdk proteins are relatively stable throughout the cell cycle ; however , the concentrations of cyclin fluctuate and determine when Cdk / cyclin complexes form . The different cyclins and Cdks bind at specific points in the cell cycle and thus regulate different checkpoints . Since the cyclic fluctuations of cyclin levels are based on the timing of the cell cycle and not on specific events , regulation of the cell cycle usually occurs by either the Cdk molecules alone or the Cdk / cyclin complexes . Without a specific concentration of fully activated cyclin / Cdk complexes , the cell cycle cannot proceed through the checkpoints .",

The collective function of the best-understood tumor suppressor gene proteins , Rb , p53 , and p21 , is to put up a roadblock to cell cycle progression until certain events are completed . A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem .

        "context": " Since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy , and enzymes lower and determine activation energies for chemical reactions , the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at which rates .  This determination is tightly controlled . In certain cellular environments , enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors , like pH and temperature . There are other mechanisms through which cells control the activity of enzymes and determine the rates at which various biochemical reactions will occur .  The activation energy of a particular reaction determines the rate at which it will proceed .   The higher the activation energy , the slower the chemical reaction will be .  The example of iron rusting illustrates an inherently slow reaction . This reaction occurs slowly over time because of its high E A . Additionally , the burning of many fuels , which is strongly exergonic , will take place at a negligible rate unless their activation energy is overcome by sufficient heat from a spark . Once they begin to burn , however , the chemical reactions release enough heat to continue the burning process , supplying the activation energy for surrounding fuel molecules . Like these reactions outside of cells , the activation energy for most cellular reactions is too high for heat energy to overcome at efficient rates . In other words , in order for important cellular reactions to occur at appreciable rates ( number of reactions per unit time ) , their activation energies must be lowered ( Figure 6.10 ); this is referred to as catalysis . This is a very good thing as far as living cells are concerned . Important macromolecules , such as proteins , DNA , and RNA , store considerable energy , and their breakdown is exergonic . If cellular temperatures alone provided enough heat energy for these exergonic reactions to overcome their activation barriers , the essential components of a cell would disintegrate .",

Indeed , the familiar mushroom is a reproductive structure used by many types of fungi . However , there are also many fungi species that don't produce mushrooms at all . Being eukaryotes , a typical fungal cell contains a true nucleus and many membrane-bound organelles . The kingdom Fungi includes an enormous variety of living organisms collectively referred to as Eucomycota , or true Fungi . While scientists have identified about 100,000 species of fungi , this is only a fraction of the 1.5 million species of fungus likely present on Earth . Edible mushrooms , yeasts , black mold , and the producer of the antibiotic penicillin , Penicillium notatum , are all members of the kingdom Fungi , which belongs to the domain Eukarya . Fungi , once considered plant-like organisms , are more closely related to animals than plants . Fungi are not capable of photosynthesis : they are heterotrophic because they use complex organic compounds as sources of energy and carbon . Some fungal organisms multiply only asexually , whereas others undergo both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction with alternation of generations . Most fungi produce a large number of spores , which are haploid cells that can undergo mitosis to form multicellular , haploid individuals .  Like bacteria , fungi play an essential role in ecosystems because they are decomposers and participate in the cycling of nutrients by breaking down organic materials to simple molecules .  Fungi often interact with other organisms , forming beneficial or mutualistic associations . For example most terrestrial plants form symbiotic relationships with fungi . The roots of the plant connect with the underground parts of the fungus forming mycorrhizae . Through mycorrhizae , the fungus and plant exchange nutrients and water , greatly aiding the survival of both species Alternatively , lichens are an association between a fungus and its photosynthetic partner ( usually an alga ) . Fungi also cause serious infections in plants and animals . For example , Dutch elm disease , which is caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi , is a particularly devastating type of fungal infestation that destroys many native species of elm ( Ulmus sp . ) by infecting the tree ' s vascular system . The elm bark beetle acts as a vector , transmitting the disease from tree to tree . Accidentally introduced in the 1900s , the fungus decimated elm trees across the continent . Many European and Asiatic elms are less susceptible to Dutch elm disease than American elms . In humans , fungal infections are generally considered challenging to treat . Unlike bacteria , fungi do not respond to traditional antibiotic therapy , since they are eukaryotes . Fungal infections may prove deadly for individuals with compromised immune systems . Fungi have many commercial applications . The food industry uses yeasts in baking , brewing , and cheese and wine making . Many industrial compounds are byproducts of fungal fermentation . Fungi are the source of many commercial enzymes and antibiotics .",

        "question": "In the past, the United States manufactured clothes. Many clothing corporations have shut down their American factories and relocated to China. What is this an example of?",
        "context": " Big Picture Capital Flight , Outsourcing , and Jobs in America As mentioned above , capital flight describes jobs and infrastructure moving from one nation to another .  Look at the American automobile industry . In the early 20th century , the cars driven in America were made in America , employing thousands of workers in Detroit , and providing an abundance of jobs in the factories and companies that produced everything that made building cars possible . However , once the fuel crisis of the 1970s hit and Americans increasingly looked to imported cars with better gas mileage , American auto manufacturing began to decline . During the recession of 2008 , the U . S . government bailed out the three main auto companies , underscoring their vulnerability . At the same time , Japanese-owned Toyota and Honda and South Korean Kia maintained stable sales levels . The World Bank defines high-income nations as having a gross national income of at least $ 12,276 per capita . It separates out the OECD ( Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development ) countries , a group of 34 nations whose governments work together to promote economic growth and sustainability . According to the Work Bank ( 2011 ) , in 2010 , the average GNI of a high-income nation belonging to the OECD was $ 40,136 per capita and the total population was over one billion ( 1,032 , 856,261 ); on average , 77 percent of the population in these nations was urban . Some of these countries include the United States , Germany , Canada , and the United Kingdom ( World Bank 2011 ) . In 2010 , the average GNI of a high-income nation that did not belong to the OECD was $ 23,839 per capita and the average population was about 94 million , of which 83 percent was urban . Examples of these countries include Saudi Arabia and Qatar ( World Bank 2011 ) . There are two major issues facing high-income countries : capital flight and deindustrialization .  Capital flight refers to the movement ( flight ) of capital from one nation to another , as when General Motors automotive company closed American factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico .   Deindustrialization , a related issue , occurs as a consequence of capital flight , as no new companies open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations .  As expected , global companies move their industrial processes to the places where they can get the most production with the least cost , including the building of infrastructure , training of workers , shipment of goods , and , of course , employee wages . This means that as emerging economies create their own industrial zones , global companies see the opportunity for existing infrastructure and much lower costs . Those opportunities lead to businesses closing the factories that provide jobs to the middle-class within core nations and moving their industrial production to peripheral and semi-peripheral nations .",

        "context": " Dependency theory was created in part as a response to the western-centric mindset of modernization theory .  It states that global inequality is primarily caused by core nations ( or high-income nations ) exploiting semi-peripheral and peripheral nations ( or middle-income and low-income nations ) , creating a cycle of dependence ( Hendricks 2010 ) . As long as peripheral nations are dependent on core nations for economic stimulus and access to a larger piece of the global economy , they will never achieve stable and consistent economic growth . Further , the theory states that since core nations , as well as the World Bank , choose which countries to make loans to , and for what they will loan funds , they are creating highly segmented labor markets that are built to benefit the dominant market countries .  At first glance , it seems this theory ignores the formerly low-income nations that are now considered middle-income nations and are on their way to becoming high-income nations and major players in the global economy , such as China .  But some dependency theorists would state that it is in the best interests of core nations to ensure the long-term usefulness of their peripheral and semi-peripheral partners . Following that theory , sociologists have found that entities are more likely to outsource a significant portion of a company ' s work if they are the dominant player in the equation ; in other words , companies want to see their partner countries healthy enough to provide work , but not so healthy as to establish a threat ( Caniels and Roeleveld 2009 ) .",

        "context": " In plants , carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) enters the leaves through stomata , where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells .   Once in the mesophyll cells , CO 2 diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast -- the site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis .  These reactions actually have several names associated with them . Another term , the Calvin cycle , is named for the man who discovered it , and because these reactions function as a cycle . Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery . The most outdated name is dark reactions , because light is not directly required ( Figure 8.17 ) . However , the term dark reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light , which is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it . In plants , photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves , which consist of several layers of cells . The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll . The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small , regulated openings called stomata ( singular : stoma ) , which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance . The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf , which helps to minimize water loss . Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes .  In all autotrophic eukaryotes , photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast .   For plants , chloroplast-containing cells exist in the mesophyll .  Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope ( composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane ) . Within the chloroplast are stacked , disc-shaped structures called thylakoids . Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll , a pigment ( molecule that absorbs light ) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material , and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain . The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen . As shown in Figure 8.6 , a stack of thylakoids is called a granum , and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or \" bed \" ( not to be confused with stoma or \" mouth , \" an opening on the leaf epidermis ) .

The main reason for this loss is the second law of thermodynamics , which states that whenever energy is converted from one form to another , there is a tendency toward disorder ( entropy ) in the system .  In biologic systems , this means a great deal of energy is lost as metabolic heat when the organisms from one trophic level consume the next level . In the Silver Springs ecosystem example ( Figure 46.8 ) , we see that the primary consumers produced 1103 kcal / m 2 / yr from the 7618 kcal / m 2 / yr of energy available to them from the primary producers .

Hyperpolarization in a postsynaptic potential is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential ( IPSP ) because it causes the membrane potential to move away from threshold .  Graded potentials can be of two sorts , either they are depolarizing or hyperpolarizing ( Figure 12.25 ) . For a membrane at the resting potential , a graded potential represents a change in that voltage either above - 70 mV or below - 70 mV . Depolarizing graded potentials are often the result of Na + or Ca 2 + entering the cell . Both of these ions have higher concentrations outside the cell than inside ; because they have a positive charge , they will move into the cell causing it to become less negative relative to the outside .  Hyperpolarizing graded potentials can be caused by K + leaving the cell or Cl - entering the cell .

        "context": " An endocrine gland may also secrete a hormone in response to the presence of another hormone produced by a different endocrine gland .   Such hormonal stimuli often involve the hypothalamus , which produces releasing and inhibiting hormones that control the secretion of a variety of pituitary hormones .   In endocrine signaling , hormones secreted into the extracellular fluid diffuse into the blood or lymph , and can then travel great distances throughout the body .  In contrast , autocrine signaling takes place within the same cell . An autocrine ( auto - = \" self \" ) is a chemical that elicits a response in the same cell that secreted it . Interleukin - 1 , or IL - 1 , is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in inflammatory response . The cells that secrete IL - 1 have receptors on their cell surface that bind these molecules , resulting in autocrine signaling .  Structures of the Endocrine System The endocrine system consists of cells , tissues , and organs that secrete hormones as a primary or secondary function .   The endocrine gland is the major player in this system .   The primary function of these ductless glands is to secrete their hormones directly into the surrounding fluid .   The interstitial fluid and the blood vessels then transport the hormones throughout the body .  The endocrine system includes the pituitary , thyroid , parathyroid , adrenal , and pineal glands ( Figure 17.2 ) . Some of these glands have both endocrine and non-endocrine functions . For example , the pancreas contains cells that function in digestion as well as cells that secrete the hormones insulin and glucagon , which regulate blood glucose levels . The hypothalamus , thymus , heart , kidneys , stomach , small intestine , liver , skin , female ovaries , and male testes are other organs that contain cells with endocrine function . Moreover , adipose tissue has long been known to produce hormones , and recent research has revealed that even bone tissue has endocrine functions . The ductless endocrine glands are not to be confused with the body ' s exocrine system , whose glands release their secretions through ducts .

These hormones increase the heart rate , pulse , and blood pressure to prepare the body to fight the perceived threat or flee from it .  In addition , the pathway dilates the airways , raising blood oxygen levels . It also prompts vasodilation , further increasing the oxygenation of important organs such as the lungs , brain , heart , and skeletal muscle . At the same time , it triggers vasoconstriction to blood vessels serving less essential organs such as the gastrointestinal tract , kidneys , and skin , and downregulates some components of the immune system . Other effects include a dry mouth , loss of appetite , pupil dilation , and a loss of peripheral vision . The major hormones of the adrenal glands are summarized in Table 17.5 . In addition to these chemical signals , hormones can also be released in response to neural stimuli .  A common example of neural stimuli is the activation of the fight-or-flight response by the sympathetic nervous system .

        "context": " The deepest region of the adrenal cortex is the zona reticularis , which produces small amounts of a class of steroid sex hormones called androgens .  During puberty and most of adulthood , androgens are produced in the gonads . The androgens produced in the zona reticularis supplement the gonadal androgens . They are produced in response to ACTH from the anterior pituitary and are converted in the tissues to testosterone or estrogens . In adult women , they may contribute to the sex drive , but their function in adult men is not well understood . In post-menopausal women , as the functions of the ovaries decline , the main source of estrogens becomes the androgens produced by the zona reticularis . The primary hormones derived from lipids are steroids . Steroid hormones are derived from the lipid cholesterol .  For example , the reproductive hormones testosterone and the estrogens -- which are produced by the gonads ( testes and ovaries ) -- are steroid hormones .  The adrenal glands produce the steroid hormone aldosterone , which is involved in osmoregulation , and cortisol , which plays a role in metabolism .",

        "context": "The endocrine system can be exploited for illegal or unethical purposes . A prominent example of this is the use of steroid drugs by professional athletes . Commonly used for performance enhancement , anabolic steroids are synthetic versions of the male sex hormone , testosterone .  By boosting natural levels of this hormone , athletes experience increased muscle mass .  Synthetic versions of human growth hormone are also used to build muscle mass . The use of performance-enhancing drugs is banned by all major collegiate and professional sports organizations in the United States because they impart an unfair advantage to athletes who take them . In addition , the drugs can cause significant and dangerous side effects . For example , anabolic steroid use can increase cholesterol levels , raise blood pressure , and damage the liver . Altered testosterone levels ( both too low or too high ) have been implicated in causing structural damage to the heart , and increasing the risk for cardiac arrhythmias , heart attacks , congestive heart failure , and sudden death . Paradoxically , steroids can have a feminizing effect in males , including shriveled testicles and enlarged breast tissue . In females , their use can cause masculinizing effects such as an enlarged clitoris and growth of facial hair . In both sexes , their use can promote increased aggression ( commonly known as \" roid-rage \" ) , depression , sleep disturbances , severe acne , and infertility . 17.9 The Endocrine Pancreas Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to : The kidneys participate in several complex endocrine pathways and produce certain hormones . A decline in blood flow to the kidneys stimulates them to release the enzyme renin , triggering the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone ( RAAS ) system , and stimulating the reabsorption of sodium and water . The reabsorption increases blood flow and blood pressure . The kidneys also play a role in regulating blood calcium levels through the production of calcitriol from vitamin D 3 , which is released in response to the secretion of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . In addition , the kidneys produce the hormone erythropoietin ( EPO ) in response to low oxygen levels .

        "question": "In the elderly, what causes decreased thyroid function?",
        "context": "In areas of the world with access to iodized salt , dietary deficiency is rare . Instead , inflammation of the thyroid gland is the more common cause of low blood levels of thyroid hormones . Called hypothyroidism , the condition is characterized by a low metabolic rate , weight gain , cold extremities , constipation , reduced libido , menstrual irregularities , and reduced mental activity . In contrast , hyperthyroidism -- an abnormally elevated blood level of thyroid hormones -- is often caused by a pituitary or thyroid tumor . In Graves ' disease , the hyperthyroid state results from an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies overstimulate the follicle cells of the thyroid gland .  Hyperthyroidism can lead to an increased metabolic rate , excessive body heat and sweating , diarrhea , weight loss , tremors , and increased heart rate .  The person ' s eyes may bulge ( called exophthalmos ) as antibodies produce inflammation in the soft tissues of the orbits . The person may also develop a goiter .  The thyroid hormones , T 3 and T 4 , are often referred to as metabolic hormones because their levels influence the body ' s basal metabolic rate , the amount of energy used by the body at rest .  When T 3 and T 4 bind to intracellular receptors located on the mitochondria , they cause an increase in nutrient breakdown and the use of oxygen to produce ATP . In addition , T 3 and T 4 initiate the transcription of genes involved in glucose oxidation . Although these mechanisms prompt cells to produce more ATP , the process is inefficient , and an abnormally increased level of heat is released as a byproduct of these reactions . This so-called calorigenic effect ( calor - = \" heat \" ) raises body temperature .  As the body ages , the thyroid gland produces less of the thyroid hormones , causing a gradual decrease in the basal metabolic rate .  The lower metabolic rate reduces the production of body heat and increases levels of body fat . Parathyroid hormones , on the other hand , increase with age . This may be because of reduced dietary calcium levels , causing a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone . However , increased parathyroid hormone levels combined with decreased levels of calcitonin ( and estrogens in women ) can lead to osteoporosis as PTH stimulates demineralization of bones to increase blood calcium levels . Notice that osteoporosis is common in both elderly males and females .",

Studying the body parts tells us not only the roles of the organs in question but also how the species may have evolved . One such structure that is used in classification of animals is the coelom . A coelom is a body cavity that forms during early embryonic development .  The coelom allows for compartmentalization of the body parts , so that different organ systems can evolve and nutrient transport is possible .   Additionally , because the coelom is a fluid-filled cavity , it protects the organs from shock and compression .   Simple animals , such as worms and jellyfish , do not have a coelom .  All vertebrates have a coelom that helped them evolve complex organ systems .  Most animal species undergo a separation of tissues into germ layers during embryonic development .  Recall that these germ layers are formed during gastrulation , and that they are predetermined to develop into the animal ' s specialized tissues and organs .  Animals develop either two or three embryonic germs layers ( Figure 27.9 ) .   The animals that display radial symmetry develop two germ layers , an inner layer ( endoderm ) and an outer layer ( ectoderm ) .   These animals are called diploblasts .

Nucleic acid and protein analyses have greatly informed the modern phylogenetic animal tree .  These data come from a variety of molecular sources , such as mitochondrial DNA , nuclear DNA , ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) , and certain cellular proteins .  Many evolutionary relationships in the modern tree have only recently been determined due to molecular evidence .   For example , a previously classified group of animals called lophophorates , which included brachiopods and bryozoans , were long-thought to be primitive deuterostomes .  Extensive molecular analysis using rRNA data found these animals to be protostomes , more closely related to annelids and mollusks .  This discovery allowed for the distinction of the protostome clade , the lophotrochozoans .  Molecular data have also shed light on some differences within the lophotrochozoan group , and some scientists believe that the phyla Platyhelminthes and Rotifera within this group should actually belong to their own group of protostomes termed Platyzoa .  Eumetazoa are subdivided into radially symmetrical animals and bilaterally symmetrical animals , and are thus classified into clade Bilateria or Radiata , respectively .  As mentioned earlier , the cnidarians and ctenophores are animal phyla with true radial symmetry . All other Eumetazoa are members of the Bilateria clade . The bilaterally symmetrical animals are further divided into deuterostomes ( including chordates and echinoderms ) and two distinct clades of protostomes ( including ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans ) ( Figure 27.13 ab ) . Ecdysozoa includes nematodes and arthropods ; they are so named for a commonly found characteristic among the group : exoskeletal molting ( termed ecdysis ) . Lophotrochozoa is named for two structural features , each common to certain phyla within the clade .

        "context": " The Cambrian Explosion of Animal Life The Cambrian period , occurring between approximately 542 - 488 million years ago , marks the most rapid evolution of new animal phyla and animal diversity in Earth ' s history .  It is believed that most of the animal phyla in existence today had their origins during this time , often referred to as the Cambrian explosion ( Figure 27.16 ) . Echinoderms , mollusks , worms , arthropods , and chordates arose during this period . One of the most dominant species during the Cambrian period was the trilobite , an arthropod that was among the first animals to exhibit a sense of vision ( Figure 27.17 abcd ) . The cause of the Cambrian explosion is still debated . There are many theories that attempt to answer this question . Environmental changes may have created a more suitable environment for animal life . Examples of these changes include rising atmospheric oxygen levels and large increases in oceanic calcium concentrations that preceded the Cambrian period ( Figure 27.18 ) . Some scientists believe that an expansive , continental shelf with numerous shallow lagoons or pools provided the necessary living space for larger numbers of different types of animals to co-exist . There is also support for theories that argue that ecological relationships between species , such as changes in the food web , competition for food and space , and predator-prey relationships , were primed to promote a sudden massive coevolution of species . Yet other theories claim genetic and developmental reasons for the Cambrian explosion . The morphological flexibility and complexity of animal development afforded by the evolution of Hox control genes may have provided the necessary opportunities for increases in possible animal morphologies at the time of the Cambrian period . Theories that attempt to explain why the Cambrian explosion happened must be able to provide valid reasons for the massive animal diversification , as well as explain why it happened when it did . There is evidence that both supports and refutes each of the theories described above , and the answer may very well be a combination of these and other theories .",

        "context": " Another mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous period , bringing the Mesozoic Era to an end .  Skies darkened and temperatures fell as a large meteor impact and tons of volcanic ash blocked incoming sunlight . Plants died , herbivores and carnivores starved , and the mostly cold-blooded dinosaurs ceded their dominance of the landscape to more warm-blooded mammals . In the following Cenozoic Era , mammals radiated into terrestrial and aquatic niches once occupied by dinosaurs , and birds , the warm-blooded offshoots of one line of the ruling reptiles , became aerial specialists . The appearance and dominance of flowering plants in the Cenozoic Era created new niches for insects , as well as for birds and mammals . Changes in animal species diversity during the late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic were also promoted by a dramatic shift in Earth ' s geography , as continental plates slid over the crust into their current positions , leaving some animal groups isolated on islands and continents , or separated by mountain ranges or inland seas from other competitors . Early in the Cenozoic , new ecosystems appeared , with the evolution of grasses and coral reefs .  Late in the Cenozoic , further extinctions followed by speciation occurred during ice ages that covered high latitudes with ice and then retreated , leaving new open spaces for colonization .  Changes in the environment often create new niches ( living spaces ) that contribute to rapid speciation and increased diversity . On the other hand , cataclysmic events , such as volcanic eruptions and meteor strikes that obliterate life , can result in devastating losses of diversity .  Such periods of mass extinction ( Figure 27.19 ) have occurred repeatedly in the evolutionary record of life , erasing some genetic lines while creating room for others to evolve into the empty niches left behind .   The end of the Permian period ( and the Paleozoic Era ) was marked by the largest mass extinction event in Earth ' s history , a loss of roughly 95 percent of the extant species at that time .  Some of the dominant phyla in the world ' s oceans , such as the trilobites , disappeared completely . On land , the disappearance of some dominant species of Permian reptiles made it possible for a new line of reptiles to emerge , the dinosaurs . The warm and stable climatic conditions of the ensuing Mesozoic Era promoted an explosive diversification of dinosaurs into every conceivable niche in land , air , and water . Plants , too , radiated into new landscapes and empty niches , creating complex communities of producers and consumers , some of which became very large on the abundant food available .",

Two criteria to consider when classifying the types of muscle fibers are how fast some fibers contract relative to others , and how fibers produce ATP . Using these criteria , there are three main types of skeletal muscle fibers .  Slow oxidative ( SO ) fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration ( oxygen and glucose ) to produce ATP .   Fast oxidative ( FO ) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration , but because they may switch to anaerobic respiration ( glycolysis ) , can fatigue more quickly than SO fibers .

FG fibers are used to produce rapid , forceful contractions to make quick , powerful movements . These fibers fatigue quickly , permitting them to only be used for short periods . Most muscles possess a mixture of each fiber type . The predominant fiber type in a muscle is determined by the primary function of the muscle . 10.6 Exercise and Muscle Performance Learning Objectives By the end of this section , you will be able to : Two criteria to consider when classifying the types of muscle fibers are how fast some fibers contract relative to others , and how fibers produce ATP . Using these criteria , there are three main types of skeletal muscle fibers . Slow oxidative ( SO ) fibers contract relatively slowly and use aerobic respiration ( oxygen and glucose ) to produce ATP . Fast oxidative ( FO ) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use aerobic respiration , but because they may switch to anaerobic respiration ( glycolysis ) , can fatigue more quickly than SO fibers .  Lastly , fast glycolytic ( FG ) fibers have fast contractions and primarily use anaerobic glycolysis .  The FG fibers fatigue more quickly than the others . Most skeletal muscles in a human contain ( s ) all three types , although in varying proportions .",

SO fibers are extensively supplied with blood capillaries to supply O 2 from the red blood cells in the bloodstream .  The SO fibers also possess myoglobin , an O 2 - carrying molecule similar to O 2 - carrying hemoglobin in the red blood cells .  The myoglobin stores some of the needed O 2 within the fibers themselves ( and gives SO fibers their red color ) .

        "context": "Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley ( 1864 - 1929 ) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two categories : primary groups and secondary groups ( Cooley 1909 ) . According to Cooley , primary groups play the most critical role in our lives . The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up of individuals who generally engage face-to-face in long-term emotional ways . This group serves emotional needs : expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones . The primary group is usually made up of significant others , those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization . The best example of a primary group is the family .  Secondary groups are often larger and impersonal .   They may also be task-focused and time-limited .   These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one , meaning that their role is more goal - or task-oriented than emotional .  A classroom or office can be an example of a secondary group . Neither primary nor secondary groups are bound by strict definitions or set limits . In fact , people can move from one group to another . A graduate seminar , for example , can start as a secondary group focused on the class at hand , but as the students work together throughout their program , they may find common interests and strong ties that transform them into a primary group .",

        "context": "One of the ways that groups can be powerful is through inclusion , and its inverse , exclusion . In-groups and out-groups are subcategories of primary and secondary groups that help identify this dynamic . Primary groups consist of both in-groups and out-groups , as do secondary groups . The feeling that one belongs in an elite or select group is a heady one , while the feeling of not being allowed in , or of being in competition with a group , can be motivating in a different way . Sociologist William Sumner ( 1840 - 1910 ) developed the concepts of in-group and out-group to explain this phenomenon ( Sumner 1906 ) .  In short , an in-group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to , and she believes it to be an integral part of who she is .  An out-group , conversely , is a group someone doesn ' t belong to ; often there may be a feeling of disdain or competition in relation to an out-group .  Sports teams , unions , and sororities are examples of in-groups and out-groups ; people may belong to , or be an outsider to , any of these .   While these affiliations can be neutral or even positive , such as the case of a team sport competition , the concept of in-groups and out-groups can also explain some negative human behavior , such as white supremacist movements like the Ku Klux Klan , or the bullying of gay or lesbian students .   By defining others as \" not like us \" and inferior , in-groups can end up practicing ethnocentrism , racism , sexism , ageism , and heterosexism -- manners of judging others negatively based on their culture , race , sex , age , or sexuality .  Often , in-groups can form within a secondary group . For instance , a workplace can have cliques of people , from senior executives who play golf together , to engineers who write code together , to young singles who socialize after hours . While these in-groups might show favoritism and affinity for other in-group members , the overall organization may be unable or unwilling to acknowledge it . Therefore , it pays to be wary of the politics of in-groups , since members may exclude others as a form of gaining status within the group .",

One can imagine that an army general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader . In contrast , expressive leaders are more concerned with promoting emotional strength and health , and ensuring that people feel supported .  Social and religious leaders -- rabbis , priests , imams , directors of youth homes and social service programs -- are often perceived as expressive leaders .  There is a longstanding stereotype that men are more instrumental leaders and women are more expressive leaders . And although gender roles have changed , even today many women and men who exhibit the opposite-gender manner can be seen as deviants and can encounter resistance . Secretary of State and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton provides an example of how society reacts to a high-profile woman who is an instrumental leader .

These leaders work hard to build consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward .   This type of leader is particularly common , for example , in a club where the members vote on which activities or projects to pursue .   These leaders can be well liked , but there is often a challenge that the work will proceed slowly since consensus building is time-consuming .   A further risk is that group members might pick sides and entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution .  In contrast , a laissez-faire leader ( French for \" leave it alone \" ) is hands-off , allowing group members to self-manage and make their own decisions . An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art cupboard , leaves materials on the shelves , and tells students to help themselves and make some art . While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and guidelines , it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress . As the name suggests , authoritarian leaders issue orders and assigns tasks . These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus on meeting goals . Often , entrepreneurs fall into this mold , like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg . Not surprisingly , this type of leader risks alienating the workers . There are times , however , when this style of leadership can be required . In different circumstances , each of these leadership styles can be effective and successful .

The Audubon Society or a ski club are examples of normative organizations . Coercive organizations are groups that one must be coerced , or pushed , to join . These may include prison or a rehabilitation center . Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total institutions ( 1961 ) . A total institution refers to one in which inmates live a controlled lifestyle and in which total resocialization takes place .

This business model includes efficiency ( the division of labor ) , predictability , calculability , and control ( monitoring ) . For example , in your average chain grocery store , people at the register check out customers while stockers keep the shelves full of goods and deli workers slice meats and cheese to order ( efficiency ) . Whenever you enter a store within that grocery chain , you receive the same type of goods , see the same store organization , and find the same brands at the same prices ( predictability ) . You will find that goods are sold by the pound , so that you can weigh your fruit and vegetable purchase rather than simply guessing at the price for that bag of onions , while the employees use a timecard to calculate their hours and receive overtime pay ( calculability ) . Finally , you will notice that all store employees are wearing a uniform ( and usually a name tag ) so that they can be easily identified . There are security cameras to monitor the store , and some parts of the store , such as the stockroom , are generally considered off-limits to customers ( control ) .  While McDonaldization has resulted in improved profits and an increased availability of various goods and services to more people worldwide , it has also reduced the variety of goods available in the marketplace while rendering available products uniform , generic , and bland .

Development of these circulatory elements within the embryo itself begins approximately 2 days later . You will learn more about the formation and function of these early structures when you study the chapter on development .

        "question": "Which characteristic is shared by prokaryotes and eukaryotes?",
        "context": " Mitochondria that carry out aerobic respiration have their own genomes , with genes similar to those in alpha-proteobacteria .  However , many of the genes for respiratory proteins are located in the nucleus . When these genes are compared to those of other organisms , they appear to be of alpha-proteobacterial origin .  Additionally , in some eukaryotic groups , such genes are found in the mitochondria , whereas in other groups , they are found in the nucleus .   This has been interpreted as evidence that genes have been transferred from the endosymbiont chromosome to the host genome .  This loss of genes by the endosymbiont is probably one explanation why mitochondria cannot live without a host .  One of the major features distinguishing prokaryotes from eukaryotes is the presence of mitochondria .  Eukaryotic cells may contain anywhere from one to several thousand mitochondria , depending on the cell ' s level of energy consumption . Each mitochondrion measures 1 to 10 or greater micrometers in length and exists in the cell as an organelle that can be ovoid to worm-shaped to intricately branched ( Figure 23.2 ) . Mitochondria arise from the division of existing mitochondria ; they may fuse together ; and they may be moved around inside the cell by interactions with the cytoskeleton . However , mitochondria cannot survive outside the cell . As the atmosphere was oxygenated by photosynthesis , and as successful aerobic prokaryotes evolved , evidence suggests that an ancestral cell with some membrane compartmentalization engulfed a free-living aerobic prokaryote , specifically an alpha-proteobacterium , thereby giving the host cell the ability to use oxygen to release energy stored in nutrients . Alpha-proteobacteria are a large group of bacteria that includes species symbiotic with plants , disease organisms that can infect humans via ticks , and many free-living species that use light for energy . Several lines of evidence support that mitochondria are derived from this endosymbiotic event . Most mitochondria are shaped like alpha-proteobacteria and are surrounded by two membranes . The mitochondrial inner membrane is extensive and involves substantial infoldings called cristae that resemble the textured , outer surface of alpha-proteobacteria . The matrix and inner membrane are rich with the enzymes necessary for aerobic respiration . Mitochondria divide independently by a process that resembles binary fission in prokaryotes . Specifically , mitochondria are not formed from scratch ( de novo ) by the eukaryotic cell ; they reproduce within it and are distributed with the cytoplasm when a cell divides or two cells fuse . Therefore , although these organelles are highly integrated into the eukaryotic cell , they still reproduce as if they are independent organisms within the cell . However , their reproduction is synchronized with the activity and division of the cell . Mitochondria have their own ( usually ) circular DNA chromosome that is stabilized by attachments to the inner membrane and carries genes similar to genes expressed by alpha-proteobacteria . Mitochondria also have special ribosomes and transfer RNAs that resemble these components in prokaryotes . These features all support that mitochondria were once free-living prokaryotes .  A cytoskeleton containing the structural and motility components called actin microfilaments and microtubules .   All extant eukaryotes have these cytoskeletal elements .

The plastids of chlorarachniophytes are surrounded by four membranes : The first two correspond to the inner and outer membranes of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium , the third corresponds to the green alga , and the fourth corresponds to the vacuole that surrounded the green alga when it was engulfed by the chlorarachniophyte ancestor .

While it is impossible to calculate exactly where an electron is located , scientists know that it is most probably located within its orbital path . Subshells are designated by the letter s , p , d , and f . The s subshell is spherical in shape and has one orbital .  Principal shell 1n has only a single s orbital , which can hold two electrons .   Principal shell 2n has one s and one p subshell , and can hold a total of eight electrons .  The p subshell has three dumbbell-shaped orbitals , as illustrated in Figure 2.8 . Subshells d and f have more complex shapes and contain five and seven orbitals , respectively .

The broad , superior region , defined laterally by the large , fan-like portion of the upper hip bone , is called the greater pelvis ( greater pelvic cavity ; false pelvis ) . This broad area is occupied by portions of the small and large intestines , and because it is more closely associated with the abdominal cavity , it is sometimes referred to as the false pelvis . More inferiorly , the narrow , rounded space of the lesser pelvis ( lesser pelvic cavity ; true pelvis ) contains the bladder and other pelvic organs , and thus is also known as the true pelvis . The pelvic brim ( also known as the pelvic inlet ) forms the superior margin of the lesser pelvis , separating it from the greater pelvis . The pelvic brim is defined by a line formed by the upper margin of the pubic symphysis anteriorly , and the pectineal line of the pubis , the arcuate line of the ilium , and the sacral promontory ( the anterior margin of the superior sacrum ) posteriorly . The inferior limit of the lesser pelvic cavity is called the pelvic outlet . This large opening is defined by the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis anteriorly , and the ischiopubic ramus , the ischial tuberosity , the sacrotuberous ligament , and the inferior tip of the coccyx posteriorly . Because of the anterior tilt of the pelvis , the lesser pelvis is also angled , giving it an anterosuperior ( pelvic inlet ) to posteroinferior ( pelvic outlet ) orientation . Comparison of the Female and Male Pelvis The differences between the adult female and male pelvis relate to function and body size . In general , the bones of the male pelvis are thicker and heavier , adapted for support of the male ' s heavier physical build and stronger muscles . The greater sciatic notch of the male hip bone is narrower and deeper than the broader notch of females . Because the female pelvis is adapted for childbirth , it is wider than the male pelvis , as evidenced by the distance between the anterior superior iliac spines ( see Figure 8.15 ) . The ischial tuberosities of females are also farther apart , which increases the size of the pelvic outlet .  Because of this increased pelvic width , the subpubic angle is larger in females ( greater than 80 degrees ) than it is in males ( less than 70 degrees ) .  The female sacrum is wider , shorter , and less curved , and the sacral promontory projects less into the pelvic cavity , thus giving the female pelvic inlet ( pelvic brim ) a more rounded or oval shape compared to males . The lesser pelvic cavity of females is also wider and more shallow than the narrower , deeper , and tapering lesser pelvis of males .

        "context": "Fertilization is a numbers game .  During ejaculation , hundreds of millions of sperm ( spermatozoa ) are released into the vagina .   Almost immediately , millions of these sperm are overcome by the acidity of the vagina ( approximately pH 3.8 ) , and millions more may be blocked from entering the uterus by thick cervical mucus .   Of those that do enter , thousands are destroyed by phagocytic uterine leukocytes .   Thus , the race into the uterine tubes , which is the most typical site for sperm to encounter the oocyte , is reduced to a few thousand contenders .  Their journey -- thought to be facilitated by uterine contractions -- usually takes from 30 minutes to 2 hours . If the sperm do not encounter an oocyte immediately , they can survive in the uterine tubes for another 3 - 5 days . Thus , fertilization can still occur if intercourse takes place a few days before ovulation . In comparison , an oocyte can survive independently for only approximately 24 hours following ovulation . Intercourse more than a day after ovulation will therefore usually not result in fertilization .",

        "context": " First , recall that progesterone inhibits uterine contractions throughout the first several months of pregnancy .  As the pregnancy enters its seventh month , progesterone levels plateau and then drop . Estrogen levels , however , continue to rise in the maternal circulation ( Figure 28.20 ) . The increasing ratio of estrogen to progesterone makes the myometrium ( the uterine smooth muscle ) more sensitive to stimuli that promote contractions ( because progesterone no longer inhibits them ) . Moreover , in the eighth month of pregnancy , fetal cortisol rises , which boosts estrogen secretion by the placenta and further overpowers the uterine-calming effects of progesterone . Some women may feel the result of the decreasing levels of progesterone in late pregnancy as weak and irregular peristaltic Braxton Hicks contractions , also called false labor . These contractions can often be relieved with rest or hydration . The placenta takes over the synthesis and secretion of progesterone throughout pregnancy as the corpus luteum degenerates .  Like estrogen , progesterone suppresses FSH and LH .   It also inhibits uterine contractions , protecting the fetus from preterm birth .   This hormone decreases in late gestation , allowing uterine contractions to intensify and eventually progress to true labor .  The placenta also produces hCG . In addition to promoting survival of the corpus luteum , hCG stimulates the male fetal gonads to secrete testosterone , which is essential for the development of the male reproductive system .",

More than 80 percent of angiosperms depend on animals for pollination : the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma . Consequently , plants have developed many adaptations to attract pollinators . The specificity of specialized plant structures that target animals can be very surprising . It is possible , for example , to determine the type of pollinator favored by a plant just from the flower ' s characteristics .  Many bird or insect-pollinated flowers secrete nectar , which is a sugary liquid .   They also produce both fertile pollen , for reproduction , and sterile pollen rich in nutrients for birds and insects .   Butterflies and bees can detect ultraviolet light .   Flowers that attract these pollinators usually display a pattern of low ultraviolet reflectance that helps them quickly locate the flower's center and collect nectar while being dusted with pollen ( Figure 26.19 ) .  Large , red flowers with little smell and a long funnel shape are preferred by hummingbirds , who have good color perception , a poor sense of smell , and need a strong perch .  White flowers opened at night attract moths .   Other animals -- such as bats , lemurs , and lizards -- can also act as pollinating agents .

        "context": "Soil bacteria , collectively called rhizobia , symbiotically interact with legume roots to form specialized structures called nodules , in which nitrogen fixation takes place . This process entails the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia , by means of the enzyme nitrogenase . Therefore , using rhizobia is a natural and environmentally friendly way to fertilize plants , as opposed to chemical fertilization that uses a nonrenewable resource , such as natural gas .  Through symbiotic nitrogen fixation , the plant benefits from using an endless source of nitrogen from the atmosphere .  The process simultaneously contributes to soil fertility because the plant root system leaves behind some of the biologically available nitrogen . As in any symbiosis , both organisms benefit from the interaction : the plant obtains ammonia , and bacteria obtain carbon compounds generated through photosynthesis , as well as a protected niche in which to grow ( Figure 31.10 ) . Nitrogen is an important macronutrient because it is part of nucleic acids and proteins . Atmospheric nitrogen , which is the diatomic molecule N 2 , or dinitrogen , is the largest pool of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems .  However , plants cannot take advantage of this nitrogen because they do not have the necessary enzymes to convert it into biologically useful forms .   However , nitrogen can be \" fixed , \" which means that it can be converted to ammonia ( NH 3 ) through biological , physical , or chemical processes .   As you have learned , biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen ( N 2 ) into ammonia ( NH 3 ) , exclusively carried out by prokaryotes such as soil bacteria or cyanobacteria .  Biological processes contribute 65 percent of the nitrogen used in agriculture . The following equation represents the process : Plant cells need essential substances , collectively called nutrients , to sustain life . Plant nutrients may be composed of either organic or inorganic compounds . An organic compound is a chemical compound that contains carbon , such as carbon dioxide obtained from the atmosphere . Carbon that was obtained from atmospheric CO2 composes the majority of the dry mass within most plants . An inorganic compound does not contain carbon and is not part of , or produced by , a living organism .

        "context": " The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves are also responsible for the initiation of salivation .  Neurons in the salivary nuclei of the medulla project through these two nerves as preganglionic fibers , and synapse in ganglia located in the head . The parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion , which projects to the submandibular gland and sublingual gland . The parasympathetic fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve synapse in the otic ganglion , which projects to the parotid gland . Salivation in response to food in the oral cavity is based on a visceral reflex arc within the facial or glossopharyngeal nerves . Other stimuli that stimulate salivation are coordinated through the hypothalamus , such as the smell and sight of food .  The facial and glossopharyngeal nerves convey gustatory stimulation to the brain .  Testing this is as simple as introducing salty , sour , bitter , or sweet stimuli to either side of the tongue . The patient should respond to the taste stimulus before retracting the tongue into the mouth . Stimuli applied to specific locations on the tongue will dissolve into the saliva and may stimulate taste buds connected to either the left or right of the nerves , masking any lateral deficits . Along with taste , the glossopharyngeal nerve relays general sensations from the pharyngeal walls . These sensations , along with certain taste stimuli , can stimulate the gag reflex . If the examiner moves the tongue depressor to contact the lateral wall of the fauces , this should elicit the gag reflex . Stimulation of either side of the fauces should elicit an equivalent response . The motor response , through contraction of the muscles of the pharynx , is mediated through the vagus nerve .

The patient is asked to hop on one foot to assess the ability to maintain balance and posture during movement . Though the station subtest appears to be similar to the Romberg test , the difference is that the patient ' s eyes are open during station .

For example , while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference , a symbolic interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact , as well as the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message . The focus on the importance of symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman ( 1922-1982 ) to develop a technique called dramaturgical analysis . Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and recognized that people ' s interactions showed patterns of cultural \" scripts . \" Because it can be unclear what part a person may play in a given situation , he or she has to improvise his or her role as the situation unfolds ( Goffman 1958 ) .",

All of these events occur only in meiosis I . Located at intervals along the synaptonemal complex are large protein assemblies called recombination nodules . These assemblies mark the points of later chiasmata and mediate the multistep process of crossover -- or genetic recombination -- between the non-sister chromatids . Near the recombination nodule on each chromatid , the double-stranded DNA is cleaved , the cut ends are modified , and a new connection is made between the non-sister chromatids . As prophase I progresses , the synaptonemal complex begins to break down and the chromosomes begin to condense . When the synaptonemal complex is gone , the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at the centromere and at chiasmata . The chiasmata remain until anaphase I . The number of chiasmata varies according to the species and the length of the chromosome . There must be at least one chiasma per chromosome for proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I , but there may be as many as 25 .  Following crossover , the synaptonemal complex breaks down and the cohesin connection between homologous pairs is also removed .   At the end of prophase I , the pairs are held together only at the chiasmata ( Figure 11.3 ) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible .

The only method that will allow a co-evolving species to maintain its own share of the resources is to also continually improve its fitness . As one species gains an advantage , this increases selection on the other species ; they must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted . No single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among the progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to improve rapidly . Species that cannot keep up become extinct .

Species with alternation of generations have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle .  The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes , because they produce gametes from specialized cells . Meiosis is not directly involved in the production of gametes in this case , because the organism that produces the gametes is already a haploid . Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote . The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte . Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores . The spores will subsequently develop into the gametophytes ( Figure 11.10 ) . Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles . What happens between these two events depends on the organism . The process of meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half . Fertilization , the joining of two haploid gametes , restores the diploid condition .  There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms : diploid-dominant , in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with most animals including humans ; haploid-dominant , in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage , such as with all fungi and some algae ; and alternation of generations , in which the two stages are apparent to different degrees depending on the group , as with plants and some algae .

IgM is usually the first antibody made during a primary response . Its 10 antigen-binding sites and large shape allow it to bind well to many bacterial surfaces . It is excellent at binding complement proteins and activating the complement cascade , consistent with its role in promoting chemotaxis , opsonization , and cell lysis .  Thus , it is a very effective antibody against bacteria at early stages of a primary antibody response .  As the primary response proceeds , the antibody produced in a B cell can change to IgG , IgA , or IgE by the process known as class switching . Class switching is the change of one antibody class to another . While the class of antibody changes , the specificity and the antigen-binding sites do not . Thus , the antibodies made are still specific to the pathogen that stimulated the initial IgM response . The complement system is a series of proteins constitutively found in the blood plasma . As such , these proteins are not considered part of the early induced immune response , even though they share features with some of the antibacterial proteins of this class .  Made in the liver , they have a variety of functions in the innate immune response , using what is known as the \" alternate pathway \" of complement activation .   Additionally , complement functions in the adaptive immune response as well , in what is called the classical pathway .   The complement system consists of several proteins that enzymatically alter and fragment later proteins in a series , which is why it is termed cascade .  Once activated , the series of reactions is irreversible , and releases fragments that have the following actions :",

Antibodies are effective against viruses mostly during protection , where an immune individual can neutralize them based on a previous exposure . Antibodies have no effect on viruses or other intracellular pathogens once they enter the cell , since antibodies are not able to penetrate the plasma membrane of the cell . Many cells respond to viral infections by downregulating their expression of MHC class I molecules . This is to the advantage of the virus , because without class I expression , cytotoxic T cells have no activity . NK cells , however , can recognize virally infected class I-negative cells and destroy them .  Thus , NK and cytotoxic T cells have complementary activities against virally infected cells . ",

Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to generate heat .  When that energy reserve is depleted , however , and the core temperature begins to drop significantly , red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen , denying the brain of this critical component of ATP production . This lack of oxygen can cause confusion , lethargy , and eventually loss of consciousness and death . The body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities , the hands and feet , in order to prevent blood from cooling there and so that the body ' s core can stay warm . Even when core body temperature remains stable , however , tissues exposed to severe cold , especially the fingers and toes , can develop frostbite when blood flow to the extremities has been much reduced .

A solution ' s pH is the negative , base - 10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion ( H + ) concentration of the solution .

That is , a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5 .

A solution with a pH of 7 is considered neutral -- neither acidic nor basic . Pure water has a pH of 7 . The lower the number below 7 , the more acidic the solution , or the greater the concentration of H + . The concentration of hydrogen ions at each pH value is 10 times different than the next pH .
